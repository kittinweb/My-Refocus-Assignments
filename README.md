# README

## Introduction

Hello there! My name is Kristina N. Tamayao-Calica, but you can call me Kitt. I've been married to my best friend for five years now, but our relationship goes back a total of 16 years. We live in Mabalacat City, Pampanga, and share our cozy 2-bedroom apartment with our adorable 2-year-old Boston Terrier named Jaxx. Fun fact: Jaxx and I share the same birthdate, August 11. After working in customer service for over 9 years, I decided to pursue my passion for web development, encouraged by my husband and my background in Information Technology.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I have a couple of hobbies that help me unwind and relax. I have a collection of books and novels, although I must admit that I rarely open them. Instead, I prefer to download their e-book versions and read them on my Kindle. I also enjoy watching English films and series, as they provide a great source of entertainment and inspiration. Another hobby of mine is playing the kalimba, a thumb piano, which I find soothing and therapeutic.

## Goals for this Year

As a web development student, my primary goal for this year is to further enhance my skills and knowledge in this field. I aim to become proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, with a focus on front-end development. Additionally, I aspire to find a stable-paying job in the web development industry that allows me to apply my newfound expertise. Alongside my professional goals, I also have personal aspirations, including purchasing a house and buying a pickup truck once I achieve stability in my career.

## Reasons for Becoming a Web Developer

Web development has always been my passion, and even during my time as a customer service representative, I found ways to incorporate HTML and CSS into my work to personalize my spiel copies. However, when my husband and I relocated to Pampanga, I made the difficult decision to leave my long-term career behind to support my husband's professional growth. It was during this transitional phase that my husband encouraged me to pursue web development, enabling me to combine my passion with my expertise in information technology.
